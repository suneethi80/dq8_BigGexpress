Predicting truck derate based on truck vehicle onboard diagnostic data

Goal : Predict when truck will derate based on the truck's vehicle diagnostics data and the fault codes

Preprocessing steps done:
1) Minimum cleaning done to make sure only equipment id with certain criteria are included
2) Certain locations removed since they were service locations
3) Since the predictions involved time data, a rolling time window calculations done prior to using prediction model building

Tools Used: Python and machine learning model
